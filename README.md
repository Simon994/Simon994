### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a budding new developer, currently based in the UK. 

After several years in scientific research and editing - where I collaborated with software engineers, data scientists, UX designers, chemists, and physicists - I decided to pivot my career to development. 

Iâ€™m currently learning React, as part of a broader focus on JavaScript.  

Take a look at my personal website: https://simon994.github.io/.
