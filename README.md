### Hi! 👋

<!--
**Simon994/Simon994** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a junior developer, currently based in the UK. 

After several years in scientific research and editing - where I collaborated with software engineers, data scientists, UX designers, chemists, and physicists - I decided to pivot my career to development. 

I’m currently learning React, as part of a broader focus on JavaScript.
