### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, currently based in the UK. 

After several years in scientific research and editing - where I collaborated with software engineers, data scientists, UX designers, chemists, and physicists - I decided to pivot my career to development. 

My main focus is currently on Python, but my interests also include React and JavaScript, as well as several other technologies.
