### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior developer, currently based in the UK. 

My first taste of programming was during my DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford. There, I designed and programmed instruments that helped to uncover the chemistry and physics of bird navigation. I also developed a passion for publishing my results, which led me to become the editor for a portfolio of scientific journals. As an editor, I collaborated with software engineers, data scientists and UX designers to develop journal products that our readers and authors loved.

The technology-driven change I experienced in the scientific publishing industry inspired me to return to programming. Now, having completed the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, and gained experience as a Site Reliability Engineer at Dunelm, Iâ€™m looking to apply my skills for problem solving and passion for software development in an environment that encourages learning and creative, curious thinking.

My interests and current learning include JavaScript, Python, React.js and React Native, Ruby, TypeScript, and the testing frameworks Jest and Cypress.
